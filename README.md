# flow_engine
Executes a flow consisting of linked rules against incoming data

In order to run project, run following commands npm install npm run start

Then it will automatically start the project from 3000 port and it will open default browser.

For the architectural choices I made;

I used react for managing components since I currently use it in my projects. I would use redux for single source of truth and managing states however it is not necessary for this project since there is no state to be managed! I used material ui 1.3 for react ui components since it is stable and used to do. I used create-react-app for template project since it is easy to configure. (Webpack, express, babel, etc).
